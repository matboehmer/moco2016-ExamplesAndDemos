## MVCShoppingList
Demo of the Android app we discussed during our MVC session. We implemented a simple shopping list application using the MVC pattern. See source code comments for some more details.

## ConcurrencyDemoApp
This app module contains some examples we discussed during the class, e.g. using IntentService or AsyncTask for offloading operations to background threads.

Pull requests from my students are very welcome! :-)
